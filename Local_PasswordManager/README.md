This is a local password manager that stores your encrypted passwords in a json file and allows you to decrypt
and search for particular passwords based on the account, i.e. G-Mail, Twitter, Yahoo, Work, School, etc.

JSON - "JavaScript Object Notation is a format for structuring data. It is mainly used for storing and transferring data between the browser and the server. This package provides all the necessary tools for working with JSON Objects including parsing, serializing, deserializing, and many more."

This implementation imports the python cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt passwords.
